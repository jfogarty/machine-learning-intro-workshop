        "Genetic Algorithms have been used for years, but they have never really been the HOT NEW thing in AI.  They tend to fare better relative to other approaches where you don't have an easily computable derivative, such as you would have with gradient descent, and with discrete parameters.  They are parallelizable, and they are pretty easy to code and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Genetic Algorithms are a sort of random search, where you start with a random population of individuals with random \"genetic code\".  By iterating the learning algorithm, the individuals' genetic code undergoes mutation and crossover resulting in - on average - a slightly more fit next generation of individuals.  There are countless variations on how this is done (Do we keep some of the most fit individuals from the last generation?  What is your mutation rate?  Who gets to mate with whom?  Do we vary the number of individuals?).  These mutation and crossover operations serve to pull our solutions out of local minima and visit far flung areas of the solution space, all while hopefully conserving the parts of the solution that perform well.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Individual\n",
        "Genetic Algorithms make use of an analogy to genetics, where we use a population of randomly generated individuals, each with some genetic code.  This code represents a potential solution to the problem.  The representation of the solution depends on the particular problem we are addressing, but it generally consists of a data structure.  It could contain one or more strings like \"ACGTCACTCGGATGC\" if we are dealing with DNA, real-valued data if we are dealing with vectors, arbitrary and mutually-exclusive concepts like \"January\", \"February\", and \"December\", or anything else. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Fitness \n",
        "Since these solutions are chosen at random, some are better than others.  We need to be able to evaluate how good a particular solution is.  We do this by defining a fitness function (called an evaulation function in the example below).  This takes in an individual or its genetic code, and outputs a scalar number that allows us to compare fitness between individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mutation\n",
        "In the real world, genetic code mutates due to random events like cosmic rays and nuclear decay, or due to random transcription errors.  We simulate this in genetic algorithms with a mutation rate.  Here with a low probability, we randomly change one or more elements of the genetic code of an individual.  This might be changing a number encoded in it (either a little or a lot), flipping a bit in a string, or randomizing the month in a date-time field.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Crossover\n",
        "In the real world, mating between individuals produces offspring with genetic code that is a combination of the parents.  This is simulated with crossover.  In the first diagram below we show two parents at the top, each with different genetic material.  Two offspring are shown below, each the product of crossover.  The parent's genetic code is broken at a randomly selected point.  The right half of the red parent is attached to the left half of the blue parent to produce one offspring's genes; the remaining pieces are similarly concatenated to make the other offspring's genes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geometrically, you can think of crossover as a projection of one parent's genetic code to a random plane in the search space that contains the other parent's genetic code.  (This plane will also be aligned with one of the basis vectors of the genetic code.)  The Crossover as projection diagram below shows an example involving two parents in magenta with genetic code (0,0) and (1,1).  When crossover occurs, we produce the cyan individuals with genetic code (0,1) and (1,0) by taking the first element from one parent and the second element from the second parent.  Or phrased geometrically, by projecting one parent's point to the Y-axis (the basis vector for the second element of the genetic code), and the the other parent's point to the X-axis."
